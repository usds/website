            <p>The U.S. Digital Service is a group of geeks working across the Federal Government that uses design and technology to deliver better services to the American people.

To accomplish our mission, we hire top technologists into government for short-term tours of duty.</p>
            <p>USDS is seeking software engineers, technical product managers, and designers for tours of duty of 3 months to 4 years.</p>
