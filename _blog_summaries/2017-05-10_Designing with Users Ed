At the end of 2016, Carola Ponce, along with other members of Education Digital Service team, conducted a discovery sprint for the Federal Student Aid program (FSAID), which allows student and parents to identify themselves electronically in order to access the Federal Student Aid websites. In order to understand how the services are truly being used, interacted with, and where pain points are met, technologists at the USDS make designing with users not only a priority, but a requirement.
