## This is a second level heading

This is a paragraph, which **can** *be* ***formatted*** with [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

This is a second paragraph. To fill up some space, I will just keep typing whatever comes into my silly little brain, lorem ipsum. Is that how you spell that? I never studied Latin, and I'm not a web design type of person, as you can probably tell. I wonder if this is long enough for our purposes.

## Another second level heading

### Images

![A sample image]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/usds-logo-horizontal.png)

<!-- This is an HTML comment. This text does not appear in the browser-rendered page, but
it IS VISIBLE in the browser developer tools, so it's not the place for anything sensitive. -->

<!-- Markdown allows you to do a lot without knowing HTML or CSS. But if you do know some, you can use it 
in combination with markdown. An example follows. -->

<img alt="An image using HTML and CSS" src="/assets/img/usds-logo-horizontal.png" style="width: 300px; display: block; margin: auto;">

Be sure that all local links and images use relative URLs, like [this](/projects/ditap), because they will work no matter what version or copy of the site you're at. Avoid absolute URLs, like [this](https://usds.gov/projects/ditap), because they point to one particular version or copy of the site. Even if it's the one you want right now, it might not be for always and ever.
