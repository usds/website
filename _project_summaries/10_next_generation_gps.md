Weâ€™re collaborating with the Air Force to reduce project cost and 
schedule slip for the next generation of the U.S. Global Positioning System.
The Defense Digital Service is working alongside DoD contractors to automate
configuration, testing, integration and deployment, while also introducing DevOps
methods. The next iteration of GPS will provide dramatic improvements to location 
accuracy and signal acquisition to continue supporting billions of
users across the globe.
