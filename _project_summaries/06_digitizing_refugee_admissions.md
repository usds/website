We worked with the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security to launch a digital approval
stamp process for Federal agencies processing refugees who have already been interviewed in-person, and who 
have cleared all security and background checks. More than 57% of cases require this action, so having the
flexibility to conduct it from any location at any time is a significant benefit. The digital stamp approval
process is the teamâ€™s first step towards modernizing the refugee admissions process by increasing officer
efficiency and reducing wait time for applicants, while upholding rigorous security standards.
