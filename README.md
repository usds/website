US Digital Service Website
==========================

This repo is for our public-facing site, which is hosted on dds.mil.  This site is the main funnel for DDS recruiting and outreach.

The site is built on the [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://playbook.cio.gov/designstandards/) and uses Jekyll to generate static pages.
