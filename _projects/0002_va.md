## Overview

The U.S. DOGE Service is partnering with the Department of Veterans Affairs to transform veteran care by modernizing legacy systems that have long lagged behind. The VA turned to USDS after experiencing complacency from a prior contractor that failed to innovate or deliver meaningful advances—prompting a bold shift toward cutting-edge, high-impact solutions.

Together, we're rooting out inefficiencies, improper payments, and outdated processes while delivering faster, more secure, and truly seamless benefits and services that honor our nation's heroes. These efforts directly touch over 600,000 veterans each month—along with millions of Veterans, active-duty members in transition, families, and caregivers—by dramatically reducing wait times, eliminating administrative friction, preventing errors at scale, and creating integrated, user-centered experiences that make VA faster, fairer, and genuinely veteran-focused.

## Modernized VA Disability Compensation Application Process

Revolutionizing the VA disability claims system to eliminate months-long waits that leave veterans in limbo—deploying cutting-edge modernization to streamline applications, accelerate decisions, and ensure deserving heroes get the benefits they earned without endless red tape.

- **Who this serves:** Veterans filing disability claims (over 600,000 monthly), their families, and survivors relying on timely compensation.
- **What's changing:** Legacy, paper-heavy processes transformed into efficient, digital workflows that crush delays and boost accuracy.
- **The impact:** Dramatic reduction in processing times (from months toward record lows around 85 days), billions in prevented improper payments and backlog shrinkage (backlog down to ~100,000 claims in January 2026), faster financial relief, and restored trust for America's veterans.

## Integrated Veterans' Appointment Management Experience

Unleashing a game-changing, unified platform integrated with the modern Electronic Health Record—empowering veterans with effortless, all-in-one access to view, schedule, request, cancel, check-in, set preferences, handle travel reimbursement, receive notifications, complete pre- and post-appointment workflows, and access after-visit summaries in one seamless digital hub.

- **Who this serves:** Veterans seeking care, caregivers coordinating appointments, and VA providers delivering efficient services nationwide.
- **What's changing:** Fragmented, outdated scheduling tools replaced with a patient-centered, EHR-integrated system that simplifies every step of the appointment journey.
- **The impact:** Lightning-fast access to care, reduced no-shows and administrative waste, enhanced coordination during the accelerated Federal EHR rollout (multiple sites going live in 2026), massive time savings for veterans, and stronger fraud protections through secure, real-time data.
