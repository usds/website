## Overview

The U.S. DOGE Service is modernizing the FAFSA application system in collaboration with the Department of Education, ensuring that millions of students can continue applying for and receiving vital financial aid without disruption, while improving how government serves the American people at critical moments in their lives. This work includes implementing key requirements from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), such as overhauling student loan repayment options—replacing outdated plans with simpler, more accountable structures like the new Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP)—and updating Pell Grant eligibility and administration to promote fairness, sustainability, and better outcomes for students.

## Modernizing the FAFSA Application System

Unleashing a streamlined, reliable platform that ensures 18 million students can seamlessly apply for and receive federal financial aid—empowering learners with fast, accurate access to grants, loans, and support while safeguarding over $120 billion in taxpayer dollars annually.

- **Who this serves:** Millions of students pursuing higher education, families navigating aid processes, schools administering funds, and future graduates building brighter careers nationwide.
- **What's changing:** Outdated, error-prone FAFSA systems replaced with a modernized, user-friendly application experience that incorporates key requirements from the OBBBA, including simplified student loan repayment structures—phasing out complex legacy plans in favor of accountable options like the new Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP)—and targeted updates to Pell Grant eligibility and administration.
- **The impact:** Dramatically reduced processing delays and barriers, minimized errors and improper disbursements, enhanced protection of federal funds, smoother transitions for students and families, and greater accountability in higher education.
