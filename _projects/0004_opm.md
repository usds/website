## Overview

U.S. DOGE Service is currently working with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to modernize federal workforce systems—strengthening safeguards against waste, fraud, and misuse while always putting people first in transforming hiring, talent acquisition, and IT infrastructure to better serve the American people. We assist agencies in formulating actionable plans to recruit top talent, including young innovators, by streamlining processes directly benefiting millions of federal employees, job seekers, Veterans, students, and diverse communities with faster access to opportunities, reduced administrative burdens, minimized improper payments, and secure, efficient data-driven recruitment at a national scale.

## Modernized Federal Talent Recruitment and Acquisition

We are revolutionizing OPM's talent ecosystem by accelerating recruitment of skilled professionals, including young tech-savvy talent, while eliminating vulnerabilities to waste, fraud, and abuse through automated, secure verification and data standards.

- **Who this serves:** Aspiring federal employees, including young professionals, students, Veterans, and diverse job seekers; current federal workers seeking career growth; and agencies needing top talent to drive mission success.
- **What's changing:** Legacy paper-based and slow hiring processes replaced with efficient, digital workflows that enable paperless transfers and targeted recruitment.
- **The impact:** Slashing hiring timelines from months to weeks, preventing billions in improper payments and inefficiencies, boosting workforce diversity with a focus on young innovators, and enhancing overall federal performance.
