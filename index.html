      </h3>
      <p>To strengthen data security at the Department of Defense (DoD), the Defense Digital Service launched &#8220;Hack the Pentagon,&#8221; the first bug bounty program in the history of the federal government. Adopting this commercial sector best practice allows the Department to crowdsource quick security solutions for DoD assets at low cost. The program won praise from Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, who wrote: &#8220;I am confident this innovative initiative will strengthen our digital defenses and ultimately enhance our national security.&#8221;</p>
