introduction:
  title: 'Introduction'
  section_text: |-
    The United States Digital Service team is committed to ensuring the security of the American public by protecting their information. This policy is intended to give security researchers clear guidelines for conducting vulnerability discovery activities and to convey our preferences in how to submit discovered vulnerabilities to us. This policy describes what systems and types of research are covered under this policy, how to send us vulnerability reports, and how long we ask security researchers to wait before publicly disclosing vulnerabilities. We encourage you to contact us to report potential vulnerabilities in our systems.

guidelines:
  title: 'Guidelines'

    Under this policy, "research" means activities in which you:
       - Notify us as soon as possible after you discover a real or potential security issue.
       - Make every effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of user experience, disruption to production systems, and destruction or manipulation of data.
       - Only use exploits to the extent necessary to confirm a vulnerability’s presence. Do not use an exploit to compromise or exfiltrate data, establish persistent command line access, or use the exploit to pivot to other systems.
       - Provide us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before you disclose it publicly.
       - Do not submit a high volume of low-quality reports.

    Once you’ve established that a vulnerability exists or encounter any sensitive data (including personally identifiable information, financial information, or proprietary information or trade secrets of any party), you must stop your test, notify us immediately, and not disclose this data to anyone else.

scope:
  title: 'Scope'
  section_text: |-
    This policy applies to the following systems and services:

    - *.usds.gov
    
    - *.unitedstatesdigitalservice.gov
 
    Any service not expressly listed above, such as any connected services, are excluded from scope and are not authorized for testing. Additionally, vulnerabilities found in systems from our vendors fall outside of this policy’s scope and should be reported directly to the vendor according to their disclosure policy (if any). If you aren’t sure whether a system is in scope or not, contact us at <infrastructure@usds.gov> before starting your research.
 
    Though we develop and maintain other internet-accessible systems or services, we ask that active research and testing only be conducted on the systems and services covered by the scope of this document. If there is a particular system not in scope that you think merits testing, please contact us to discuss it first. We will increase the scope of this policy over time.

reporting:
  title: 'Reporting a vulnerability'
  section_text: |-
    Information submitted under this policy will be used for defensive purposes only – to mitigate or remediate vulnerabilities. If your findings include newly discovered vulnerabilities that affect all users of a product or service and not solely United States Digital Service, we may share your report with the other organizations as needed to coordinate and remediate the vulnerability. We will not share your name or contact information without express permission.

    We accept vulnerability reports via <infrastructure@usds.gov>. Reports may be submitted anonymously. If you share contact information, we will acknowledge receipt of your report within 3 business days.

questions:
  title: 'Questions'
  section_text: |-
    Questions regarding this policy may be sent to infrastructure@usds.gov. We also invite you to contact us with suggestions for improving this policy.
