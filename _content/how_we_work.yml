     With tours of service lasting no more than 4 years, we bring a steady influx of fresh perspectives into government. To build the best possible team, we focus on the same values in our hiring as we do in our work:
     
     •	Hire and empower great people. We work to untangle some of our nation’s most important and complex problems. We hire people with the experience and skills to understand those problems—and the empathy, curiosity, and tenacity to find new paths forward. 

     •	Design with users, not for them. We build better solutions when our team reflects the people we serve. We hire people from all backgrounds, all corners of the technology, nonprofit, and government worlds, and all across the United States.

     •	Go where the work is. We prioritize our work based on how much we’re needed—and how much we can help. We hire people with the agility to go where they’re needed most. So we can do the greatest good for the greatest number of people in the greatest need.


     Read below to learn more about who we hire and how we work. If you don’t find a description that fits you, but think you can help push our mission forward, we encourage you to still apply. For more info on USDS recruitment, [read our Hiring FAQ](../faq).

  role_1_heading: "Design and user experience"
  role_1_text: |-
    Our designers are seasoned practitioners with a range of expertise and skills from user research and content strategy to interaction, information, visual and service design. We all know that getting services and benefits from the government isn't easy, but unfortunately, it's not the only obstacle our users face. That's why it's our job to do the hard work to make it simple.

    Understanding the range of contexts our users come from is key to designing quality government digital experiences. The sixth USDS value is to “design with users, not for them.” What’s implicit in that is that designing with users means all users regardless of their ability, context, or demographics. We’re designing technology for a diverse population so our research participants should be equally diverse. Our objective is to make content easily understandable and design for simplicity, consistency, and ease of use.

  role_2_heading: "Engineering"
  role_2_text: |-
    Our engineers think about the big picture, which doesn’t always involve writing code, and adapt to constraints to be effective on high-impact projects. Our engineers are mission-driven and span the full range of service delivery including frontend, backend, full-stack, site reliability, security, and data. We are not your typical software engineering shop. Successful engineers at USDS come from all over America—in every sense of the phrase. We promise you will work on something meaningful and important and invite you to hold us to that.

    Expertise in legacy technologies is not necessary, but an ability to adapt to whatever you find under the covers is. Engineering at USDS involves a willingness to lead, in both delivery and mentorship. We iterate on a system and adapt to feedback and changing needs, rather than get locked in to what was decided in a 3-year-old design phase. To get to frequent releases, we build and leverage the capabilities we get with modern infrastructure and automation, like continuous integration and testing. Large 3 or 6-month releases change many things at once, which means a release is a high-risk event. So, we work hard to build confidence in an infrastructure that does small releases more frequently.

  role_3_heading: "Product, strategy, and operations"
  role_3_text: |-
    Our product managers and strategists come from a wide variety of backgrounds, but all of us are experts in getting things done while keeping quality high. Some are industry-hardened PMs from Silicon Valley, some are savvy and clever government specialists, others bring their own special blend of skills and experience.

    Just like in private industry, every project at USDS has its own needs and quirks that change over time—flexibility and keeping a cool head in the face of ambiguity are some of the most important skills. We keep the focus on data to make product decisions based on reality, not politics. We write tickets and prioritise backlogs as well as negotiate contracts and present to high-level stakeholders. We do whatever needs to be done—we are the glue that holds everything else together.
