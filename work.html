	FIXME: tell DDS side of story.
	Hundreds of thousands of Veterans have waited more than three years for a final disability claim appeal decision, relying on a complex and duplicative process. A comprehensive solution requires Congress to act and the Administration has called on them to do just that, but we are also doing what we can in the meantime. With the Board of Veterans&#8217; Appeals, we launched Caseflow Certification, a simple web-app to improve paperless appeals processing by detecting if required documentation has been added before an appeal can move forward. This simple check helps reduce preventable errors and avoidable delays caused by disjointed, manual processing.

      </h3>
      <p>To strengthen data security at the Department of Defense (DoD), the Defense Digital Service launched &#8220;Hack the Pentagon,&#8221; the first bug bounty program in the history of the federal government. Adopting this commercial sector best practice allows the Department to crowdsource quick security solutions for DoD assets at low cost. The program won praise from Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, who wrote: &#8220;I am confident this innovative initiative will strengthen our digital defenses and ultimately enhance our national security.&#8221;</p>
